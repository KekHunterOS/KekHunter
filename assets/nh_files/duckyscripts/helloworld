REM Please checkout https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Duckyscript for the ducky command.
REM You can use the ducky command for converting the input to shell base command.
REM If the very first character is in UPPERCASE, then the whole line will be treated as ducky script.
REM e.g 'CTRL alt dEleTe' is a valid ducky command, but 'ctrl alt delete' is not.
REM If the very first character is in lower case, the whole line will be treated as a shell script.
REM e.g 'touch /sdcard/abcdefghijklmn.txt'
REM So the most beautiful is you can just add your shell script between the ducky commands, see the example below!

echo "[!] I am so nervous as this is my first time to use it!"
REM Use shell for loop to loop 2 times..
for i in 0 1
do
REM Sleep for 1 second
DELAY 1000
STRING 1234567890
ENTER
STRING abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
ENTER
STRING ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
ENTER
STRING ~!@#$%^&*()+-=/.,[]{}'"\/|?<>
ENTER

REM The REPEAT command will repeat the last command which will be this REM command
REPEAT 2
done
